Build Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.9.
GIT command line tools are required.
Additionally my atools static library is needed.

- Clone atools GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git)
- Clone littlexpconnect GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/littlexpconnect.git) into the same
  directory as atools

Windows
------------------------------------------------------

You need the MSYS2 64 Bit environment to build a 64 bit version of this plugin.

Install MSYS2, update and then install the additonal packages:
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-qt mingw-w64-i686-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-qt mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5

- Make sure SimConnect for FSX or P3D is installed for the atools library.
- Get and install Qt Creator from http://www.qt.io.
- Use "../build-%{CurrentProject:Name}-%{CurrentBuild:Name}" for "Default build directory"
  in the Qt Creator options dialog.
- Import atools and littlexpconnect into the workspace.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
-- Clone atools from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\atools"
-- For atools use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-atools-release"
-- Clone littlexpconnect from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\littlexpconnect"
-- For littlexpconnect use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-littlexpconnect-release"
- Adapt the QT_BIN, GIT_BIN, SIMCONNECT and other variables in "littlexpconnect.pro".
- Set the build kit for atools and littlexpconnect to MinGW 32bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator for all projects
- Build all projects from Qt Creator
- Create and run the target "deploy". This will create a director ..\deploy\Little XpConnect with the plugin.

Do not use the default shadow build directory names, this will break project dependencies.

Linux / macOS
------------------------------------------------------
Install Qt development packages. Version at least 5.9.

Build atools according to instructions in BUILD.txt.

Create all build directories on the same level as the source directories "atools" and "littlexpconnect".

To build the release version:
- mkdir build-littlexpconnect-release
- cd build-littlexpconnect-release
- qmake ../littlexpconnect/littlexpconnect.pro CONFIG+=release
- make

To build the debug version:
- mkdir build-littlexpconnect-debug
- cd build-littlexpconnect-debug
- qmake ../littlexpconnect/littlexpconnect.pro CONFIG+=debug
- make

Branches / Project Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to use the correct branches to avoid breaking dependencies.
The branch master is the unstable development branch but all software should compile there.

For releases check the release/MAJOR.MINOR branches to get the correct dependencies.
The atools branch is usually one MAJOR number ahead.

So Little Navconnect branch release/1.2 should work well with atools release/2.2 for example.
