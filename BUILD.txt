Build Instructions
------------------------------------------------------

Qt development packages of Core, Widgets, XML and SQL are needed with minimum version 5.6.
GIT command line tools are required.
The marble widget is needed (see https://techbase.kde.org/Marble#Compiling_Marble).
Additionally my atools static library is needed.

- Clone atools GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/atools.git)
- Clone littlenavmap GIT repository (git clone https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap.git) into the same
  directory as atools

Get Marble from my repository which contains a few needed improvements:
https://github.com/albar965/marble.git
Build an install it according to the included instructions. Use branch lnm/1.1 for the builds.

Windows
------------------------------------------------------

- Get "Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1u" from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
  and install it.
- Make sure SimConnect is installed.
- Get and install Qt Creator from http://www.qt.io.
- Use "../build-%{CurrentProject:Name}-%{CurrentBuild:Name}" for "Default build directory"
     in the Qt Creator options dialog.
- Import atools and littlenavmap into the workspace.
- Configure the projects and enable shadow build for release or debug versions.
-- Clone atools from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\atools"
-- For atools use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-atools-release"
-- Clone littlenavmap from GIT to e.g.: "C:\Projects\littlenavmap"
-- For littlenavmap use the build directory of e.g.: "C:\Projects\build-littlenavmap-release"
- Adapt the QT_BIN, GIT_BIN, SIMCONNECT and other variables in "littlenavmap.pro".
- Set the build kit for atools and littlenavmap to MinGW 32bit.
- Run qmake from Qt Creator for all projects
- Build all projects from Qt Creator

Do not use the default shadow build directory names, this will break project dependencies.

Linux / macOS
------------------------------------------------------
Install Qt development packages. Version at least 5.6.

Build atools according to instructions in BUILD.txt.

Create all build directories on the same level as the source directories "atools" and "littlenavmap".

To build the release version:
- mkdir build-littlenavmap-release
- cd build-littlenavmap-release
- qmake ../littlenavmap/littlenavmap.pro CONFIG+=release
- make

To build the debug version:
- mkdir build-littlenavmap-debug
- cd build-littlenavmap-debug
- qmake ../littlenavmap/littlenavmap.pro CONFIG+=debug
- make

Branches / Project Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------

Little Navmap has to be built using the mingw environment as Marble compiles only on the same.

Make sure to use the correct branches to avoid breaking dependencies.
The branch master is the unstable development branch but all software should compile there.

For releases check the release/MAJOR.MINOR branches to get the correct dependencies.
The atools branch is usually one MAJOR number ahead.

So Little Navmap branch release/1.2 should work well with atools release/2.2 for example.
